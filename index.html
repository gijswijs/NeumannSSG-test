          &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been following Bitcoin and more importantly the Blockchain from the sidelines for a few years now, but I wanted to get my hands dirty. Obviously I could just download the Bitcoin Core executables from bitcoin.org, but I always feel it gives me more insight if I build something myself. Also it&amp;#39;s was a nice test case for Bash on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
